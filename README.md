# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 - Python Solutions

> *"The elves are at it again, and this time they've brought programming puzzles!"*

Welcome to my collection of Advent of Code 2025 solutions. This repository is where I solve the daily puzzles, experiment with different approaches, and I occasionally take things a bit further than necessary simply because it's fun.

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual December event created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). It's an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language. Each day from December 1st to 25th, a new two-part puzzle is released at midnight EST/UTC-5.

Think of it as:
- 🎯 Daily puzzles that grow more challenging over time
- 🧩 Tasks ranging from light warmups to deep brain melters
- 🎓 A great way to explore algorithms, data structures, and creative problem solving

The puzzles often involve helping Santa, elves, reindeer, and various other holiday characters solve computational problems to save Christmas.

## 🎨 Project Features

This repo is more than a folder of scripts. It includes a bit of structure, some quality of life tools, and a workflow that makes running the puzzles pleasant.

**What Makes This Special:**
- ✨ Clean and consistent solution format
- 🎨 Colored terminal output for clearer results
- ⚡ Automatic timing decorator for every solution

## 🚀 Running Solutions

### Run a Single Day
```bash
cd day_1
python3 solution.py
```

### Run All Days (The Fun Way!)
```bash
python3 run_all.py
```

## 🎯 Personal Stats

- **Days Completed**: 12/12
- **Lines of Code**: Too many
- **Hours Spent Refactoring**: Don't ask
- **Coffee Consumed**: ☕☕☕☕☕☕
- **Sanity Remaining**: 42%

## 🎄 Final Thoughts

If you're reading this, you're probably also doing Advent of Code. Good luck, have fun, and remember:

> *"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors."*

May your runtime be O(1) and your bugs be obvious! 🎅

*Built with ❤️, Python 3, and an unreasonable amount of terminal escape codes.*
